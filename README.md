# 📊 Customer Segmentation – RFM & K-Means Clustering

A segmentation initiative conducted during my internship at Reliance BP Mobility, analyzing over 15,000 customers across 1,400 fuel outlets. Using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering, the project aimed to personalize loyalty strategies, reduce churn, and improve offer redemption efficiency.
